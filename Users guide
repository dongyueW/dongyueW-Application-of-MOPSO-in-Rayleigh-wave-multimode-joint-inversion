This is model A(the S-wave velocities increase with depth) in the manuscript.

1.Using forward.p to get the theoretical dispersion curve, get the file theoretical_dispersion.mat.
2.Using MOPSO.m to inverse the dispersion data,get some inversion results.Selecting the most symmetrical model.    The file has the data we got before[Symmetric_model((I got it before)).mat].
3.Using Average_results.m to to average the obtained data.Using the average result as the final inversion result.
4.Ploting of inversion results obtained  dispersion_compare.m and plot_profiles.m.
