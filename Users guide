This is model A(the S-wave velocities increase with depth) in the manuscript.

1.Using forward.p to get the theoretical dispersion curve, get the file theoretical_dispersion.mat.
2.Using MOPSO.p to inverse the dispersion data,get some inversion results. Selecting the most symmetrical model.    The file has the data we got before[Symmetric_model((I got it before)).mat].
3.Using Average_results.p to to average the obtained data. Using the average result as the final inversion result.    The array extracted from Symmetric_model.mat is manually extracted from the results we get from MOPSO.p.
4.Ploting of inversion results obtained  dispersion_compare.p and plot_profiles.p.
